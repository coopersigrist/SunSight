Note: The data for Alabama did not exist. For Jan 24 and 25 (which are used for estimations of installation distribution) I estimated residential cap/gen using preportions to Mississippi in the SEIA dataset (https://seia.org/solar-state-by-state/). The generation per capacity rate was also taken to be the same as Mississippi's

Also, the original data was downloaded here: https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/state/, though the exact link may be lost -- we are working on finding the exact download


Note: Data is missinf for 2014 and 2015 AK
DC is removed from the dec_cap_per_year_per_state dataset
DC is removed from this dataset for Jan_24_25_by_state.csv -- it is included elsewhere however.

eia_household_elec_consumption.csv is data scraped from the following tables produced by the EIA:
https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/2020/c&e/pdf/ce2.5.pdf
https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/2020/c&e/pdf/ce2.4.pdf

https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/2020/c&e/pdf/ce2.2.pdf

The table contains average and RSE energy consumption per household per income level for the four different regions of the US (Northeast, West, South, Midwest) for 2020

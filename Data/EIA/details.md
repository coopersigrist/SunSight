Note: The data for Alabama and Arkansas was clearly erroneous. For Jan 24 and 25 (which are used for estimations of installation distribution) I estimated them using preportions to Mississippi in the SEIA dataset (https://seia.org/solar-state-by-state/). The generation per capacity rate was also taken to be the same as Mississippi's

Also, the original data was downloaded here: https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/state/, though the exact link may be lost -- we are working on finding the exact download
